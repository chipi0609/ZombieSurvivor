# ZombieSurvivor

This project was originally from the Imperial College 2013 Java practice test, and was played using console input and output.
This year I have decided to turn the game into a more visualized version.

The game can be played by multiple players. Players play in turns to fight with the zombies, each player can decide to fight or to score,
and after they choose to score, the next player would take the role to fight with the zombies. In the original version the amount of scores
a player can gain were calculated randomly, and not much strategies were involved, but in the upgraded version I decided to add more options.
